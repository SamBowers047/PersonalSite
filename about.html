                <h2 class="subtitles">Gaming</h2>
                <p class="aboutp">Since I was a little kid gaming has always been a passion of mine. As I've grown older it remains one of my favorite pastimes. For me a good single player game is like an escape into another world, but unlike other escapisms like books and movies, you actually get to interact with the world. Multiplayer games on the other hand are a great way to keep in touch with old friends who you don't get to see often anymore because of physical distance. These are just a couple of reasons why I enjoy video games so much.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitles">Reading</h2>
                <p class="aboutp">Reading is another way I like to spend my freetime. Most of my time reading is spent on philosophy, such as Nietzche or Jung. Jung also wrote a lot on psychology, which I also enjoy reading. When I'm not reading philosophy or psychology, I also enjoy books such as The Witcher or manga such as Berserk. </p>

                <h2 class="subtitles">My dog</h2>
                <p class="aboutp">One last thing I enjoy in my freetime is spending time with my dog Yoshi. She is a Korean Jindo that was rescued by the International Humane Society. When I first got her she was very shy and timid and wouldn't even play fetch. Over time she began to loosen up and get more comfortable around people, and one day after many attempts she finally played fetch! Since then she has been playing with toys nonstop and gets spoiled by my mom with new toys almost weekly. Playing fetch with her and taking her on walks are some of my favorite things to do.</p>
