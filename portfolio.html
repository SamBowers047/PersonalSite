                      The Right Cut (Capstone)
                    </h2>
                        <p>This app is an e-commerce website that specializes in selling different cuts of beef. Users can also make an account to leave reviews and keep track of their order history.</p>
                        <p>Created a back-end using Javascript, Express, Morgan, Dotenv, JSONwebtoken, PG, and Bcrypt, while testing with Postman as a team of three. Built the front-end using Javascript, React, HTML5, and CSS.</p>
                        <p>Back-End: Laid out a plan for API routes. Set up hashed and compared passwords with bcrypt, token with JSONwebtoken, and some of the database functions and API routes. Tested every route through Postman.</p>
                        <p>Front-End: Created a dropdown under products for filter functionality using useState, ternaries, and some CSS. Made a profile page that shows users their reviews and order history. Added the ability for an admin to edit a product. Styled much of the app with CSS.</p>
                        <p>Resolved many issues and deployed the app through heroku.</p>

                        <p>This app is a website where users can create fitness routines and view the routines of other users.</p>
                        <p>Created a back-end using Javascript, Express, Morgan, Dotenv, JSONwebtoken, PG, and Bcrypt, while testing with Postman as a team of three. Built the front-end using Javascript, React, HTML5, and CSS.</p>
                        <p>Back-End: Set up hashing and comparing passwords with bcrypt, setting up the token with JSONwebtoken, and setting up some of the tables in the database and fetch calls in the API.</p>
                        <p>Front-End: Made the forms into pop-ups through useState, ternaries, and some CSS, created UI allowing users to filter routines or activities by clicking on a username or activity, and some other minor functionality and CSS.</p>
                        <p>Resolved many bugs and errors.</p>

                      JuiceBox
                    </h2>
                        <p>This app is a back-end only project, and my first time creating a back-end.</p>
                        <p>Used dotenv and JSONwebtoken to safely store the users information. Used express, morgan, and pg to make and access the database.</p>
                        <p>This project was very difficult because it was our first time with multiple new technologies and very different to what we had been doing before. Looking back it was a very helpful experience in getting a better understanding of creating a back-end.</p>

                        <p>This app is an e-commerce website where users can buy and sell to each other.</p>
                        <p>Built the front-end using Javascript, React, HTML5, and CSS. Used a pre-existing API.</p>
                        <p>Every part of the front-end of this app was made by me. The most challenging parts were making the edit post functionality and the pop-ups. This was the first time I implemented any kind of pop-up and it was a fun challenge getting it to work.</p>
